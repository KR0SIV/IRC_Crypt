Simple AES encrypted IRC client.

Prompts users for nick/server/channel/key and uses these details to connect with other users.
Key's must match for this to work.

IV is static and hard coded.
IRC port number is hard coded.
Channel must be entered as "#example" Don't forget the hash.

Have fun and don't consider it secure, I don't know what I'm doing lol.
